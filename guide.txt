1. Clone Your Forked Repo Locally
Since you've forked the repo, work on your fork (e.g., https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TrendRadar).

Open a terminal and clone it:
This gives you a local copy to edit configs before pushing back.

2. Configure for Tech News Filtering
Edit config/frequency_words.txt to focus on tech-related news. This file uses keywords to filter what gets reported/pushed. Examples:

Add lines like: AI, 科技, 编程, 机器学习, 区块链, ChatGPT, etc. (supports Chinese/English).
Syntax: Plain words for must-match, +word for required, !word for excluded.
Default has some examples; replace or add to them.
After editing, commit and push:

3. Set Up Telegram Bot for Hourly Notifications
TrendRadar pushes to Telegram via a bot. You'll need:

Bot Token: Create a bot via Telegram's @BotFather. Send /newbot, name it, get the token (e.g., 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11).
Chat ID: Your personal chat ID (or a group/channel ID if preferred).
Send a message to your bot.
Visit https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates in a browser (replace <YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>).
Look for "chat":{"id":123456789} – that's your Chat ID.
In your forked repo on GitHub:

Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret.
Add two secrets:
Name: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN | Value: Your bot token.
Name: TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID | Value: Your chat ID.
(Optional) Add other platforms if wanted, but Telegram is sufficient.
The workflow already supports Telegram and runs every hour (cron: "0 * * * *"). It will send filternotification.enable_notification: true.
(Optional) Enable push_window if you want notifications only during certain hours (e.g., 9 AM - 6 PM).
For frequency: The default is every hour. If you want more/less, edit .github/workflows/craw is mostly Chinese; add English keywords if needed.
Security: Secrets are encrypted; don't share tokens.
This should get you running with tech news on Pages and Telegram pushes. If you run into errors during setup, share the logs or specific issues, and I can help debug! Let me know if you need code snippets or further customization.ler.yml (change cron: "0 * * * *" to "*/30 * * * *" for 30 mins, but avoid too frequent to prevent rate limits).
Commit and push changes.

4. Enable GitHub Pages for Web Display
This deploys the HTML reports (e.g., daily tech news summaries) to a live site like https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/TrendRadar.

In your forked repo: Go to Settings > Pages.
Set Source to "Deploy from a branch".
Branch: main | Folder: /(root).
Save. GitHub will build and host the site (takes 1-2 minutes).
Visit https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/TrendRadar to see the reports (updates after each workflow run).
The workflow auto-commits HTML files back to your repo, triggering Pages updates.

5. Adjust Push Mode and Frequency (If Needed)
Edit config/config.yaml locally:
Set report.mode to "current" (real-time rankings) or "daily" (end-of-day summary) – "current" is good for hourly tech updates.
Ensure 

6. Test the Setup
In your repo: Go to Actions > Hot News Crawler > Run workflow (manual trigger).
Wait 1-2 minutes. Check:
Telegram: Should receive a push with filtered tech news.
GitHub Pages: Refresh the site for updated HTML reports.
Logs: In Actions, view the run for errors (e.g., if secrets are missing).
If issues: Check the README's troubleshooting (e.g., ensure files exist, secrets are set).

7. Monitor and Maintain
Workflows run automatically every hour.
View reports: The site shows aggregated tech trends with rankings, timestamps, and new indicators (🆕).
Logs: Check Actions tab for runs.
Updates: The repo updates frequently; sync your fork via GitHub's "Sync fork" or rebase locally.
Costs: Free for basic use (GitHub Actions has limits; avoid excessive runs).
Potential Issues & Tips
No notifications? Verify secrets (case-sensitive), bot setup, and that keywords match news.
Pages not updating? Ensure the workflow commits changes; check Pages build status.
Rate limits: GitHub warns against <30-min runs; stick to hourly.
AI features: Optional; set up MCP if you want natural language queries (e.g., "Show AI trends today").
Localization: Newsed tech news matches.
